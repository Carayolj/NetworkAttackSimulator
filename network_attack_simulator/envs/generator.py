    Generate the network configuration based on standard formula.

    Machine Configuration distribution:
        1. if uniform=True
            => machine configurations are chosen uniformly at random from set of all valid
               possible configurations
        2. if uniform=False
            => machine configurations are chosen to be corelated (see below)

    CORRELATED CONFIGURATIONS:
    The distribution of configurations of each machine in the network are generated using a
    Nested Dirichlet Process, so that across the network machines will have corelated
    configurations (i.e. certain services/configurations will be more common across machines on
    the network), the degree of corelation is controlled by alpha_H and alpha_V, with lower
    values leading to greater corelation.

    lambda_V controls the average number of services running per machine. Higher values will
    mean more services (so more vulnerable) machines on average.

    EXPLOIT PROBABILITIES
    Success probabilities of each exploit are determined as follows:
        - None - probabilities generated randomly from uniform distribution
        - "mixed" - probabilities randomly chosen from distribution of low: 0.2,
            med: 0.5 and high: 0.8 with probability of level based on attack complexity
            distribution of top 10 vulnerabilities in 2017.
        - single-float - probability of each exploit is set to value
        - list of float - probability of each exploit is set to
            corresponding value in list
